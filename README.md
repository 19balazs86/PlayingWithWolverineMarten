# Playing with Wolverine and Marten

In this repository, I have started putting together some examples of using **Wolverine** and **Marten** during my learning process.

Both Wolverine and Marten are part of the "Critter Stack" family of 👤[JasperFx tools](https://github.com/JasperFx), they are [Open Source projects](https://jeremydmiller.com/open-source-projects) 📓*Jeremy Miller*.

- **Wolwerine**: Next generation Mediator and MessageBus, it is all about professional messaging
- **Marten**: Allows developers to use the PostgreSQL database as a document database and a fully-featured EventStore

They can be used individually as they serve their own purpose, but they can be integrated together to open a new door for neat features (durable Inbox and Outbox messaging).

##### The solution has the following projects

###### WolverineHttpWithMarten

- Web API using WolverineFx.Http for managing Http endpoint routing
- Using Marten to store a Product entity and DurableInbox for local queue messages in a transaction
- Apply fluent validation middleware and a custom to load Product entity by id

###### Worker.Ping

- Worker service with a few BackgroundService
- Sending in-process ping-pong messages via local queue
- Sending PingMessage via RabbitMq and listening for PongMessage (from Worker.Pong)
- Sending RequestMessage via RabbitMq and require a ResponseMessage via RabbitMq response-queue

###### Worker.Pong

- Listening for PingMessage and send a PongMessage via RabbitMq
- Getting RequestMessage via RabbitMq and send back a ResponseMessage via RabbitMq response-queue

###### WolverineHttpWithMarten.UnitTest

- An example of unit testing our work and mocking 2 main components
  - IMessageBus or IMessageContext for Wolverine with the built-in TestMessageContext
  - IDocumentSession for Marten with any framework (Moq, NSubstitute)

###### WolverineHttpWithMarten.IntegrationTest

- An example of integration testing the Web API using
  - [Alba](https://jasperfx.github.io/alba) to spin up Web API in memory using the built-in TestServer
  - [Testcontainers](https://github.com/19balazs86/PlayingWithTestContainers) to get a new PostgresDB for our test and throw it away at the end
- You can disable external Wolverine transports to have an isolated environment
- You can run HTTP requests against you API
- Wolverine provides you with a built-in mechanism called TrackedSession that ensures certain events/messages are sent out
- You can trigger any handlers by invoking them from outside and simulate that you received a message from RabbitMQ
- Using a feature of Marten, you can easily wipe out all data and initialize it again before running all the tests
- All of these features are extremely good to work with

###### EventSourcingApi

- Web API with a few endpoints to operate on Events
- Example #1: Counter - that we can increase / decrease
  - Simulate parallels access to an event-stream and using AppendExclusive to lock the actual stream
  - Apply an inline projection
  - Apply an async projection (handle an intermittent exception with retry)

> Personal opinion:
>
> - Both Wolverine and Marten are more than awesome, I enjoy working with them
> - They looks easy to use, but they can become somewhat larger animals as you discover the itsy-bitsy details
> - The documentation is very good and sufficient length to keep you occupied
> - Unit and Integration tests are like a dream with Alba (also from 'Critter Stack' family)
